## Multipage web app for epidemiological dynamic models

This work is a multipage web app able to represent and simulate epidemiological models based on plant-pathogens interactions in a mixture. Parameters can be set by the user through a slider.

The different model are: 
* Time plots for n=2 varieties. 
* Time plots for n=3 varieties.

This work is based on classical Python modules, including streamlit, and the streamlit-multipage-framework:
